## 1.20+ REQUIRES [CraterLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craterlib) - Modrinth: [CraterLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/craterlib)

**1.20.2 Notice**:

The config screen is currently broken, and so is the discord button texture in the options screen

**Changes**:

* Some known servers like Hypixel will no longer override the RPC display. You can add your own override using the server-entries config

**Bug Fixes**:

* Fixed an issue with Skin Overlays not showing with %playerhead%
